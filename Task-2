Engineering Tickets for Augur Project

Epic: Develop Augur Predictive Supply Chain Management System

User Story 1: Frontend Dashboard Setup

As a user, I want to access a browser-based dashboard to monitor distributor metrics.
Tasks:
Set up the frontend project using React framework.
Create dashboard layout with placeholders for distributor metrics.
Integrate API calls to retrieve distributor data.
Implement responsive design for various screen sizes.
User Story 2: Display Distributor Metrics

As a user, I want to view key metrics for each distributor on the dashboard.
Tasks:
Design components to display distributor name, YTD average, last month's quantity, and forecast.
Fetch and populate distributor metrics from API responses.
Implement data visualization for better user understanding.
Include sorting and filtering options for distributors.
User Story 3: Backend Integration

As a system, I need to integrate with the existing predictive shipping pipeline.
Tasks:
Create microservices for backend components (data processing, APIs).
Establish connections with messaging queues for data exchange.
Develop API endpoints to fetch distributor metrics.
Implement data transformation logic for incoming data.
User Story 4: Data Processing and Storage

As a system, I need to process and store distributor data for metrics calculation.
Tasks:
Design data models for storing monthly shipment quantities and forecasts.
Develop data processing components to aggregate and calculate metrics.
Implement logic to compute YTD average, last month's quantity, and forecast.
Integrate with the chosen database (e.g., Azure SQL Database).
User Story 5: Messaging Queue Setup

As a developer, I need to establish communication using messaging queues.
Tasks:
Choose messaging technology (e.g., Azure Service Bus) for real-time data exchange.
Set up messaging infrastructure on Azure.
Implement message producers for sending monthly shipment and forecast data.
Create message consumers for processing incoming data.
User Story 6: Azure Deployment

As a developer, I need to deploy the Augur system on Azure.
Tasks:
Configure Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) for container orchestration.
Containerize frontend and backend components.
Define deployment pipelines using Azure DevOps or similar tools.
Set up monitoring and logging using Azure services.
User Story 7: Extendibility

As a developer, I want to ensure the system's extendibility for future features.
Tasks:
Design APIs with flexibility for adding new endpoints.
Implement modular architecture for microservices.
Document best practices for adding new functionality.
Plan for potential integration with advanced analytics tools.
User Story 8: Sprint Planning and Kickoff

As a team lead, I need to plan and initiate the first sprint for Augur.
Tasks:
Review and prioritize engineering tickets.
Estimate effort and assign tickets to team members.
Set up a Trello board to track progress and manage tasks.
Conduct a sprint kickoff meeting to align the team.
By organizing these engineering tickets on a Trello board, the Augur project's first sprint can be initiated, and the development process can begin with a clear roadmap and defined tasks.
